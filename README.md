# Reasons why you should use Markdown

1. It’s easy to learn and fast to use
Without thinking, as you write plain text it is already in Markdown. Add a few rules and you have formatted text. If you prefer, you could ignore all these rules as well, and convey pure information only.

2. Markdown converts to HTML easily.
You also have the option of using HTML in your text whenever things get difficult to produce, but that seldom happens in text writing except for fancy formatting features.

3. Markdown is future proof
Markdown is plain text format. Using plain text ensures that the document can be read anywhere without special editors or file viewers. You are able to transfer the Markdown document to other formats. In fact, Markdown can be converted to a number of formats very easily (Ref: Pandoc).
Markdown has its own extension (.md), however, you could use any extension (including .txt).

4. Markdown is used everywhere
Markdown is more commonly used than you think.Without thinking, Whatsapp and online forums use a format of Markdown, for example **bold** adds bold font to your writing. Other communication tools e.g. Skype, Slack, Facebook Messenger, Wikis uses a form of Markdown.

5. You don’t have to use special software
Almost every editor has a feature that allows you to save your work in “plain text”, hence you do not need to learn how to use a new software. Most writers choose a “pure text editor” for the increased speed, program size and availability.

**Disadvantage**

1. No control over the display
2. No control over images
3. No control over layout
